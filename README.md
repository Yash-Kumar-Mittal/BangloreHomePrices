**Real Estate Price Prediction App**

This web application predicts real estate prices in Bangalore, inspired by websites like "Magicbricks.com" which estimate property prices across various regions. Our model predicts property prices based on parameters such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. Firstly, I built the model using sklearn and a machine learning algorithm with the Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. I created the web interface using Streamlit. This interface allows users to enter details like home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and it calls the model to retrieve the predicted price. During the model-building process, I encountered various data science concepts including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation.
